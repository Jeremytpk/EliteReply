2. Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
3. Enter "EliteReply Functions" as the name
4. Copy the generated 16-character password (e.g., "abcd efgh ijkl mnop")

### Step 3: Update Firebase Functions Environment
Update the `.env` file in the `functions/` directory:

cd functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

# EliteReply - Comprehensive Notification System Implementation

## üéØ Implementation Summary

This document outlines the complete implementation of a comprehensive notification system for EliteReply that ensures users receive notifications regardless of app state or current screen.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Notification Service** (`services/notifications.js`)
   - Push notifications for background/closed app states
   - Local notifications for scheduled reminders
   - Notification history storage in Firebase
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Notification Helpers** (`services/notificationHelpers.js`)
   - Specialized functions for different notification types
   - Consistent API across all notification scenarios
   - Automatic recipient resolution and validation
   - Event-specific notification formatting

3. **Global Notification Context** (`contexts/NotificationContext.js`)
   - App state monitoring (foreground/background)
   - Real-time notification listeners
   - Navigation integration for notification interactions
   - Global notification queue management

4. **In-App Notification Banner** (`components/NotificationBanner.js`)
   - Animated slide-in notifications
   - Custom sounds and visual feedback
   - Type-specific styling and icons
   - Auto-dismiss functionality
